      The first film, "Baahubali: The Beginning," introduces Shivudu, a young
      man with extraordinary strength who is raised by tribal villagers. He
      discovers his true identity as Mahendra Baahubali, the son of the late
      King Amarendra Baahubali. Through flashbacks, we learn that Amarendra was
      a beloved prince who was betrayed and killed by his cousin, Bhallaladeva,
      who became king. The second film, "Baahubali: The Conclusion," reveals
      Amarendra's backstory and the circumstances leading to his death.
      Amarendra marries Devasena, a fierce warrior princess, against
      Bhallaladeva's wishes. Bhallaladeva and his father conspire to imprison
      Devasena and kill Amarendra. Loyal subjects, including Kattappa,
      reluctantly carry out the assassination. Mahendra Baahubali returns to
      Mahishmati to avenge his father's death, free his mother, and reclaim the
      throne. He ultimately defeats Bhallaladeva in an epic battle, restoring
      peace and justice to the kingdom. The films are renowned for their grand
      scale, stunning visual effects, and compelling narrative, making
      "Baahubali" a landmark in Indian cinema. part2: baahubali the Conclusion
